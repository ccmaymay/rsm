rsm is a modified Python implementation of Replicated Softmax Model of
Salakhutdinov and Hinton (2009) [PDF],
a simple single-layer "Deep Net" for documents.
This code is a modification to a Python implementation by Joerg Landthaler,
http://www.fylance.de/rsm/,
in several aspects:

  * Includes an easy-to-use command line interface (rsm.py) where many
    hyperparameters can be specified,
  * Includes an n-step Contrastive Divergence (option -n) as opposed to the
    original code,
  * Visiting data randomly through minibatches during optimization,
  * Outputs perplexities rather than L2-norm of multinomial reconstruction,
  * And some fixes.

Download

  * rsm-0.1.tar.gz

rsm requires Numpy and Scipy as well as Python (developed with Python 2.6.6).

Getting started

Unpack the package and just type

% rsm.py -H 10 -N 20 -b 10 train model
loading data.. done.
number of documents        = 100
number of lexicon          = 1324
number of hidden variables = 10
number of learning epochs  = 20
number of CD iterations    = 1
minibatch size             = 10
learning rate              = 0.001
updates per epoch: 10 | total updates: 200
Epoch[ 0] : PPL = 994.07 [iter=1]
Epoch[ 1] : PPL = 508.56 [iter=1]
Epoch[ 2] : PPL = 400.47 [iter=1]
Epoch[ 3] : PPL = 353.96 [iter=1]
Epoch[ 4] : PPL = 334.94 [iter=1]

For detailed usage of rsm.py, type

% rsm.py -h
rsm.py, modified python implementation of Replicated Softmax Model.
$Id: rsm.py,v 1.7 2013/06/28 10:23:26 daichi Exp $
usage  : rsm.py [options] train model
options: -H hiddens number of hidden variables (default = 50)
         -N epochs  number of learning epochs (default = 1)
         -n iter    iterations of contrastive divergence (default = 1)
         -b batch   number of batch size (default = 1)
         -r rate    learning rate (default = 0.001)
%

or just execute rsm.py.

Using the model

File 'model' is a pickled Python data structure containing RSM parameters
(W_vh, W_v, W_h) in the paper as well as some information on hyperparameters.

  * To extract parameters, use hash references to the model
      + model['w_vh'] = W_vh
      + model['w_v'] = W_v
      + model['w_h'] = W_h.
    For a concrete example, see the scripts explained below.
  * For example, to map documents into hidden activations (binary coding), use
    the accompanying script "rsmhidden.py" like this: ("*" means 1, "." means
    0, "-" means 0 < h < 0.5, "+" means 0.5 < h < 1)

    % rsmhidden.py model.nips test.dat
    .*..*....*..*..*......*...*........***....*.......
    .*..*.*.....+.........*........*..................
    .**.*.-...............*.-.*......-................
    .*..*..............+..*...+.........-.............
    .*-.*.*...............*.+.*.......................
    .*..*..............-..*........+-....+............
    ..-.-........-........*.-......*.........-..+.....
    ...............-........*.-....*.........*........
    ....*.................*...........................
    .*..*.-.....*..-......*.+........-..-.............

  * To evaluate perplexities on test data, try using the script "rsmppl.py".

Data format

Training data format is just the same as lda or TinySVM, 'id:count' sequence.
id begins from 1. For a concrete example, see the file 'train' contained in the
package.

Notices and Caveats

  * rsm is originally written using Numpy ndarray (not sparse), thus runs fast
    but consumes pretty much memory.
  * Replicated Softmax Model, or RBM in general, is very hard to optimize and
    quite sensitive to hyperparameters for optimizing using stochastic
    gradients. Try many hyperparameter combinations that work well for the data
    at hand.
